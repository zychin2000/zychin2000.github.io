Hi! I'm a Computer Science Junior at San Jose State University, and I worked as a software engineer at Perksense.


### A little story

After my first experience on a computer at the age of seven, I thought being able to interact with moving pictures was magical, and as futurist Arthur C. Clarke once said, “Any sufficiently advanced technology is indistinguishable from magic.” From there, my love for computers grew as I wanted to wield and harness that magic. I began to experiment with various software, and soon wanted to learn how the screen interacts with the user. I was very happy when I created my first Visual Basic program, a label that would change based on the button you pressed, but I wasn’t satisfied. In order to make my program more complex, I watched plenty of YouTube videos and scourged on many websites to learn even more. There were plenty of little projects in between, and eventually, I made an Android app for competition in high school.

This fiery passion has carried me along to San Jose State University where I now have access to an immense amount of resources and knowledge including new languages, algorithms, applied and higher mathematics, and brilliant professors to discuss new ideas with. They all continue to develop my passion to learn, build and solve burns as I try to find an internship which could let me apply my skills and contribute to society.
